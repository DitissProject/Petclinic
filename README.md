# Petclinic
Deploying petclinic webapp using DevSecOps
In our project, we've implemented a DevSecOps pipeline for deploying a secure, automated Java web app for a pet clinic, covering both UI and back-end aspects. Hosted on an AWS EC2 t2 large instance for optimal performance, our setup integrates a variety of tools across the development lifecycle. GitHub for version control, Jenkins for CI/CD, Maven for build management, SonarQube and OWASP for quality and security checks, Docker for containerization, Trivy for image scanning, Kubernetes for orchestration, Tomcat for hosting, and Zap for security testing form the core of our infrastructure. An email system keeps stakeholders informed, ensuring our application is secure, efficient, and aligned with DevSecOps principles.
